# ds-analytics

A lightweight, reproducible workspace for data science and machine learning experiments using a modern Python toolchain (`uv`, `pyproject.toml`) and VS Code Dev Containers.

This repository provides a minimal, consistent environment for DS/ML experiments, complete with GPU support, testing, and linting.

## Key Components

- **`.devcontainer/`**: VS Code Dev Container configuration. Builds a reproducible Docker environment with Python 3.13, CUDA 13.x, and all necessary dependencies.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Project metadata and dependencies, managed by `uv`.
- **`uv.lock`**: A lockfile generated by `uv` to ensure deterministic, reproducible package installations.
- **`Makefile`**: Convenience targets for common development tasks.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks organized by learning phases (00 for sanity checks, 01-22 for curriculum phases).
- **`src/`**: Source code organized by learning plan phases (folders 01-22), containing notebooks, scripts, and projects for each week of the curriculum.
- **`tests/test_sanity.py`**: A basic unit test to verify the environment.

## Key Libraries Included

The dev container comes pre-installed with a rich set of libraries for data science, machine learning, and deep learning, including:

- **Core Data Science**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`
- **GPU Acceleration (RAPIDS)**: `cudf`, `cuml`, `cugraph`
- **Machine Learning**: `xgboost`, `optuna`
- **Deep Learning**: `torch`, `transformers`, `onnx`, `onnxruntime`
- **Data Processing**: `pyspark`, `pyarrow`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Development**: `jupyterlab`, `ruff`, `pytest`

*Note: `cuxfilter` and `faiss-gpu` are not included due to installation constraints but can be added later if needed.*

## Getting Started (Recommended)

This project is designed to be used with the included **VS Code Dev Container**, which handles all setup automatically.

**Prerequisites:**
1.  **VS Code** with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.
2.  **Docker Desktop** or another compatible container runtime.
3.  **NVIDIA GPU and drivers** on your host machine to enable GPU support inside the container.

**To launch the environment:**
1.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
2.  When prompted, click "**Reopen in Container**". (Or, press `F1` and run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`).
3.  VS Code will build the container and connect to it. This may take several minutes on the first run.
4.  If you need to rebuild the container (e.g., after dependency changes), press `F1` and run `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`.

## Available Commands

Run these commands from the integrated terminal in VS Code.

- **Run pre-commit hooks** (formatting and linting):
  ```bash
  make pre-commit
  ```

- **Run the test suite**:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```

- **Check GPU/CUDA availability**:
  ```bash
  make gpu-check
  ```

## Contributing

1.  Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2.  Make your changes inside the dev container.
3.  Run the checks locally before submitting:
    ```bash
    make pre-commit
    make test
    ```
4.  Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
